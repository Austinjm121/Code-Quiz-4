# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

### Problems I ran into, and how I solved them

- Several errors that I was stuck on throughout coding were simply syntax errors, since the code was so long and intricate compared to previous homeworks.

- I had a hard time trying to piece together how to make the quiz. I ended up different variables (questions, userQuestion, userChoices, and questionsSection, questionIndex, etc) to all come together to serve as different building blocks towards the goal of creating a quiz.

- Another big problem was trying to get the score to correctly translate over to the other html, since I've never worked on a project that uses two different htmls. This seemed like the best way to solve the problems I was having.
